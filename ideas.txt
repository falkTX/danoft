# Ideas for game "scenes"

Tests:
1. intro page with text, changes to next one after 5 secs
2. 2nd page, different, to make sure we can handle scene changes

3. scoller thing
4. collision detection
5. drawing text and allowing to click on text

## Intro

Some sort of intro, explaining there are different "games". or maybe make it a surprise?

## 1D Tetris

Just a single block falling down.
Obviously joke, for being impossible to lose.
Could be very first game.

Black borders on both sides.
Right side has "controls" help: press down to go faster, p for pause. Also high-score and current level.
Music that changes on new level. original tetris one?

If enough time: Goes faster and faster... Win at the end, with congrats.

## Pong

start very hard as joke?
and on 3 losses, make bar almost full, so almost impossible to lose?

## Flappy-bird scroller like thing

Berlin/German theme?
Add classic german folklore/pop songs for sure

## Scroller type 2? RPG?

Person collecting beers on the group
0.25â‚¬ per bottle

## Copy some card game animation, needs to be there hehe

## Game with questions, multi-answer

Leave note saying bad graphics are intentional, for artistic reasons :)

Player has to click on correct answer before the next question appears.
Make 3rd question have an incorrect answer, when player clicks on bad answer give similar error. Stop at 3 attempts.
If player insists on the obvious correct answer, give super congrats.
Needs proper logic to only give different errors. if player choses "correct" one 2 times give different error.

End showing score.
Allow to repeat :D

## Others

Investigate old daniela favorite game, based by music she sent once.
